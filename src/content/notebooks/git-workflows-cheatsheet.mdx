# Git Workflows Cheatsheet

Fast reminders for daily Git housekeeping: creating isolated worktrees, tidying history with squashed commits, and moving patches with cherry-pick.

## Worktrees

- `git worktree add ../feature-main feature/main` – create a sibling checkout at `../feature-main` from `feature/main` without touching your primary working tree.
- `git worktree list --porcelain` – enumerate worktrees with paths, branches, and linked commits (great for scripts).
- `git worktree remove ../feature-main` – delete a finished worktree safely after cleaning its working directory.
- `git worktree prune --verbose` – clear out worktree metadata for directories removed out-of-band.

```bash
# Typical flow
git fetch origin
git worktree add ../bugfix-login origin/bugfix/login
cd ../bugfix-login
# ... work, commit, push ...
cd -
git worktree remove ../bugfix-login
```

**Tips**

- Worktrees share the same `.git` directory, so hooks and config remain consistent.
- Keep worktree paths short and descriptive; prefix with the branch type (`feature-`, `hotfix-`, etc.).

## Squashing Commits

### Interactive rebase (preferred)

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase -i origin/main
# mark commits as `squash` or `fixup`
git push --force-with-lease
```

- Use `s` (squash) to merge commit messages or `f` (fixup) to keep the parent message.
- `--autosquash` pairs naturally with `git commit --fixup=<hash>`.

### Merge squash for feature branch handoff

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --squash feature/login-audit
git commit -m "feat: add login audit trail"
```

- Produces a single commit without preserving the feature branch; remember to delete the source branch afterward.

## Cherry-picking Commits

- `git cherry-pick <hash>` – apply a single commit onto the current branch.
- `git cherry-pick A^..B` – apply a range inclusive of commit `A`’s parent through `B`.
- `git cherry-pick --no-commit <hash>` – stage the changes without committing; useful for bundling multiple commits into one.

```bash
git checkout release/2025.02
git cherry-pick f2c1d7e
# resolve conflicts if any, then
git cherry-pick --continue
```

**Conflict handling**

- If a cherry-pick goes sideways, run `git cherry-pick --abort` to return to the pre-pick state.
- Re-run with `--strategy-option theirs` when the target branch should win on conflicts.

- Consider aliases in `~/.gitconfig` (`wta`, `gps`, `gcp`) to keep muscle memory sharp.
