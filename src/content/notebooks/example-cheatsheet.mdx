# Example Cheatsheet

This is an example notebook in MDX format. You can use all Markdown features plus JSX components.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Common Git commands
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

## Code Examples

```javascript
// JavaScript array methods
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = arr.map(x => x * 2);
const filtered = arr.filter(x => x > 2);
```

## Tips

- Keep notebooks focused on specific topics
- Update frequently as needed
- Easy to remove when no longer relevant
- Not included in RSS feeds

## Interactive Components

You can even import React components here if needed (since this is MDX):

```jsx
// Example: you could import and use custom components
// import MyComponent from '@components/MyComponent';
// <MyComponent />
```
