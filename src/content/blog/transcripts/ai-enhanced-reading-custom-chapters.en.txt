AI-Enhanced Reading: Generating Custom Book Chapters with Large Language Models

Have you ever finished reading a brilliant book and thought, "This is amazing, but I wish the author had covered this modern topic"? I recently had this exact experience with David Epstein's book "Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World." The book brilliantly explores how breadth of experience and diverse skills lead to greater success, but it doesn't address how AI is reshaping this dynamic.

That's when I realized: we can now use large language models to write custom chapters that extend the books we love.

The Concept: Extending Books, Not Replacing Them

Let me be clear upfront. This isn't about replacing authors or creating unofficial sequels. Instead, it's about exploring contemporary applications of timeless ideas, bridging knowledge gaps between when a book was written and today, personalizing your learning by focusing on topics that matter to you, and following the author's voice and methodology to maintain consistency.

Think of it as having a conversation with the author about how their ideas apply to new domains they might not have covered.

My Experience: Adding an AI Chapter to "Range"

"Range" makes compelling arguments about the value of diverse experiences and delayed specialization. But as AI transforms industries and careers, I wondered: How does AI impact the generalist versus specialist debate?

So I asked a large language model to write a new chapter titled "Range in the Age of AI" that would maintain the book's core thesis about the value of generalists, use Epstein's research-based approach with examples and studies, and explore specific questions like: Do large language models favor specialists with deep, narrow knowledge, or generalists with broad connections? How does AI augmentation change the skills we need? What does "range" mean when AI can simulate expertise?

The result was fascinating. The large language model generated a chapter that cited real research on AI and human cognition, used the same storytelling style as Epstein, and argued that AI actually increases the value of generalists because AI handles narrow, specialized tasks well, humans with range can spot unexpected connections AI might miss, and cross-domain thinking becomes more valuable, not less.

How to Generate Your Own Custom Chapters

Here's the process I've refined.

First, choose your book and gap. Identify a book you love and a topic the author didn't cover. The best candidates are timeless frameworks applied to modern contexts, like "Range" plus AI, pre-digital books applied to digital age challenges, or domain-specific insights extended to new domains.

Second, craft your prompt carefully. Your prompt should include: I'm reading this book title by this author. The book's main argument is this core thesis. I'd like you to write a new chapter titled this chapter title that maintains the author's voice and methodology, uses their approach of specific techniques like storytelling or research citations, explores how this new topic relates to their core ideas, and stays true to their overall thesis while acknowledging new complexities. The chapter should be this length and include an opening anecdote or example, three to five main arguments with supporting evidence, real-world examples or case studies, and a conclusion that ties back to the book's main theme.

Third, iterate and refine. The first draft might not be perfect. You can ask for more specific examples, request different angles or counterarguments, have the large language model revise sections that feel off-brand, or cross-reference claims with real research.

Fourth, verify and learn. This is a critical step. Treat the generated chapter as a starting point for learning, not gospel truth. Use it to identify topics for deeper research, discover new connections you hadn't considered, generate questions to explore further, and guide your own thinking about the intersection.

Beyond Books: Other Applications

This technique works for more than just books. You can apply it to research papers to generate accessible explanations or practical applications, historical texts to explore how old wisdom applies to modern problems, technical manuals to create use-case-specific guides, or course materials to generate supplementary content for your learning style.

The Ethical Dimension

A few important caveats. First, this is for personal learning only. Don't publish or share AI-generated chapters as if they're by the original author. Second, always acknowledge the source. Be transparent that you're using AI to extend ideas. Third, verify information. Large language models can hallucinate facts or studies. Fourth, respect intellectual property. Use this to enhance your understanding, not to replace purchasing or reading the original work. Fifth, value the original. The generated content is only valuable because it builds on the author's genuine insights.

Why This Matters

We're entering an era where learning can be infinitely more personalized. Instead of waiting for an author to write a second edition or hoping someone addresses your specific questions, you can bridge temporal gaps between publication and now, apply frameworks to your specific context, explore "what-if" scenarios the author didn't consider, and learn at the intersection of multiple domains.

This doesn't replace traditional reading. It enhances it. The original book remains the foundation, but now you can build custom extensions that make the ideas more relevant to your life and challenges.

Try It Yourself

Next time you finish a book that resonates with you, ask yourself: What topic do I wish the author had covered? Then use a large language model to explore that gap. You might be surprised at the insights you discover.

The future of reading isn't passive consumption. It's active co-creation. And with AI, we all have the tools to extend the books we love in ways that make them even more valuable.

What book would you extend? And what chapter would you add?

Note: The custom chapters you generate are for personal learning and reflection. They're thought experiments that help us apply timeless wisdom to contemporary challenges. Always read the original work first and use AI-generated extensions as supplementary learning tools.
