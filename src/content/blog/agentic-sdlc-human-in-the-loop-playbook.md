Integrating large language model (LLM) agents into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) unlocks automation and scale, but it also introduces new risks and points where human judgment is essential. This playbook lays out practical guidance for adopting an "agentic" SDLC: agents do the heavy lifting (vision, design, code, tests, monitoring) and humans review evidence at well-defined decision gates.

## Why this matters

LLM-powered agents accelerate many tasks—drafting ADRs, writing tests, generating migrations, triaging incidents—but unchecked automation can hide risk, reduce accountability, and produce brittle outcomes. Designing the process so humans review evidence (not every artifact) lets teams gain speed while preserving safety, traceability, and multi-perspective thinking.

## Core principles

- Humans review evidence, not artifacts. Agents produce designs, code, tests, and a compact evidence package (impact, risk, test results, rollback plan) for human approval.
- Roles collapse into perspectives. Agents switch perspectives—vision, design, execution, risk, observability—so teams retain the conceptual separation of concerns.
- Risk-based HITL. Only high-leverage, high-risk decisions require human sign-off. Low-risk changes can be auto-approved with controlled sampling.
- Versioned requirements. Treat requirements as code: version, diff, and analyze impact before accepting changes.

## Meta-agent roles

Organize agents around responsibilities rather than job titles:

- Vision/Strategy Agent: produces Vision Briefs and options aligned to business KPIs.
- Design/Architecture Agent: writes ADRs, fitness checks, and concise threat model digests.
- Execution Agent: generates code, tests, and migration scripts and prepares risk-weighted pull requests.
- Risk & Compliance Agent: runs license checks, dependency scans, and privacy/security scans.
- Observability Agent: validates assumptions in production, aggregates signals, and suggests next iterations.
- Orchestrator: coordinates the agents, bundles evidence, and manages escalations to humans.

## Human-in-the-Loop decision gates

Design the pipeline with clear gates where humans review evidence packages instead of full artifacts. Example gates:

1. Vision Gate — humans approve the Vision Brief (goals, KPIs, constraints). Agents present options with trade-offs.
2. Requirement Commitment Gate — thin-slice freeze for 1–3 day deliverables; changes spawn new slices with impact analysis.
3. High-Risk Design Gate — for schema changes, external contracts, or SLO-impacting designs; human reviews ADR summary + threat model digest.
4. Code Change Gate — risk score determines the path: high → human review; medium → peer-agent review; low → auto-merge with 10–20% random human sampling.
5. Release Gate — human approves rollout strategy (feature flags, canary, rollback plan), not necessarily the full diff.
6. Incident Gate — SLO breaches trigger the Orchestrator to package logs/traces and proposed fixes for a human-led blameless review.
7. Model/Tooling Change Gate — every change to the AI stack is high-risk and requires human sign-off.

## Evidence packages

At each gate agents should submit a short Evidence Pack containing:

- Change summary: what changed and why.
- Impact analysis: affected modules, contracts, and downstream consumers.
- Test evidence: coverage delta and replay of critical scenarios.
- Security/quality scans: SAST, dependency checks, and secrets scanning.
- Rollback plan: tested script or documented manual rollback steps.

Humans read the evidence and risk indicators instead of inspecting every line of code.

## Risk scoring and automation policy

Use a simple, explainable risk score to route reviews. A starting formula:

Risk = Criticality(1–5) \* ChangeSize(1–5) + CoverageGap%(0–5) + Churn(0–3) + Novelty(0–3)

Thresholds:

- High (≥10): human review required
- Medium (6–9): peer agent review
- Low (≤5): auto-approve with sampling

This lets teams automate low-risk work while reserving human attention for high-impact changes.

## Minimal viable adoption steps

1. Create documentation folders: /docs/vision, /docs/adr, /docs/risk, /docs/trace.
2. Update the PR template to require an Evidence Pack.
3. Add CODEOWNERS for high-risk modules.
4. Implement feature flags and simple canary tooling with a tested rollback script.
5. Ship a small risk-scoring script that uses diff size, test coverage, and churn.
6. Start contract tests for critical APIs.
7. Run mutation testing on key modules and track regression metrics.
8. Generate a daily Change Digest summarizing new requirements, high-risk changes, and canary signals.

## Operational notes and edge cases

- Human latency: make approval steps asynchronous and time-boxed; allow agents to proceed with safe defaults for non-blocking work.
- False positives: tune scans and risk thresholds over time; track decision outcomes to refine the policy.
- Escalation: provide a clear path for developers to escalate ambiguous decisions to a human reviewer or a cross-functional committee.

## Closing

An agentic SDLC balances efficiency with accountability: agents handle routine generation; humans evaluate the evidence for high-leverage decisions. Start small, automate low-risk changes first, and incrementally expand the agents’ remit while keeping well-defined HITL gates. Over time the process will surface better signals for both models and people—improving safety, speed, and trust.
