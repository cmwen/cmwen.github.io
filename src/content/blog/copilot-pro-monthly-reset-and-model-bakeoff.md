If you use GitHub Copilot Pro, there’s a simple but useful planning tip: the premium request quota resets on the first day of each month, regardless of when you subscribed. That means the last few days of the month are a good time to run bigger experiments or proofs of concept (POCs) so you can start fresh after the reset.

This month I used that window to run a small “model bakeoff.” I gave multiple models the same prompt and requirements and let each implement the same project a few times. I wasn’t trying to ship production code—just to see how each model behaved, which stack it picked, and how smooth the end‑to‑end experience felt inside VS Code with Copilot.

What I asked them to build: a simple habit tracker that would be nice to use on mobile. I deliberately didn’t specify a language or framework to see what the models chose on their own.

Below are the highlights, takeaways, and a few practical tips for stretching your Copilot Pro credits month‑to‑month.

## Monthly premium reset: use it to your advantage

- The premium request pool resets on the 1st of each month. Plan your heavier experimentation toward the end of the month if you still have credits left.
- Queue up a backlog of “try this idea” tasks so you can batch them when you have time and credits available.
- If a project requires multiple end‑to‑end runs (e.g., trying different stacks), do those before the reset and archive results for comparison.

## The experiment: a quick model bakeoff

I ran the same requirements several times through different models, letting Copilot do as much as possible in the editor. I observed choices, tool usage, and how far they got in a couple of runs.

Models I tried:

- Sonnet 4
- GPT‑5
- Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Grok

Same prompt, same goal: build a habit tracker that works well on mobile.

### What happened in practice

- Grok picked Flutter. It leaned on command‑line scripts frequently, which meant I needed to hop back to the terminal and approve steps. That’s not unreasonable for Flutter (the tooling is CLI‑driven), and it did target multiple platforms—especially Android—by default.

- Gemini 2.5 Pro tended to choose React Native but didn’t complete the project in a couple of runs. My impression is that this was partly an integration quirk in the VS Code + Copilot workflow: it sometimes issued shell commands instead of using editor tasks or the built‑in tools, which broke the flow.

- Sonnet 4 went with a web app and used IndexedDB for offline storage. That’s a pragmatic choice: it’s fast to scaffold, naturally mobile‑friendly in the browser, and avoids native build complexity while still working offline.

- GPT‑5 also attempted the task with a distinct approach. I focused more on how deterministic it stayed with the same instructions—the stack choices varied when I didn’t pin them down, reinforcing the value of explicit constraints if you care about the tech.

I haven’t fully tested each generated project yet, but the variety alone was interesting: given a vague brief, models gravitate to very different stacks and workflows.

## Key takeaways

1. If you don’t specify the stack, the model will. And it may not be the same each run. If you need consistency, constrain language, framework, package manager, and tooling.
2. Ask for a plan first. A short, numbered plan stabilizes the flow and creates checkpoints where you can redirect before the agent runs commands.
3. Prefer editor tasks over raw shell commands. In VS Code, asking the agent to create and use tasks can reduce environment drift and accidental failures.
4. Keep runs short and repeatable. It’s easier to compare multiple small runs with crisp acceptance criteria than one long, meandering session.
5. Archive results. Save diffs, logs, and notes per run so you can evaluate quality without relying on memory.

## A simple bakeoff template

If you want to try this yourself, here’s a lightweight template I used and refined:

1. Define an identical spec for every model. Keep it short and testable.
2. Freeze the inputs:
   - Requirements (functional + non‑functional)
   - Constraints (stack, package manager, storage, etc.)
   - Acceptance criteria (what “done” means)
3. Run 2–3 attempts per model. Don’t let any single run sprawl.
4. Collect artifacts: code, logs, generated docs, and a short self‑review.
5. Score on the basics:
   - Setup friction (commands, env issues)
   - Completeness (does it meet the spec?)
   - Stability (repeat runs, fewer retries)
   - Developer experience (tool usage that fits VS Code/Copilot)

### Example requirement (what I used)

- Build a habit tracker with the following:
  - Create habits, mark daily check‑ins, simple streaks
  - Mobile‑friendly
  - Offline first if web; local storage OK (e.g., IndexedDB)
  - README with run instructions
  - Local only (no external services)

### Example instruction block for the agent

Ask the agent to:

- Propose a plan in 5–7 steps before writing code
- Confirm the chosen stack and why
- Generate minimal scaffolding
- Add one feature at a time and self‑test
- Stop after each step and summarize next actions

## Practical tips to stretch Copilot Pro credits

- Batch experiments near month‑end. Use what remains of your premium quota on multi‑model comparisons; start month‑start with a clean slate.
- Use smaller, more focused prompts. Big, fuzzy asks consume more tokens for worse outcomes.
- Reuse a clear “system” prompt or template. Consistency reduces back‑and‑forth.
- Pin the stack when outcomes matter. Language, framework, package manager, and datastore—be explicit.
- Prefer editor‑native flows. Ask to create VS Code tasks or npm scripts rather than ad‑hoc shell commands.
- Record results as you go. A quick checklist after each run helps you decide which approach to continue.

## What I’d change next time

- Add a tiny smoke test. Even for UI projects, a minimal test (or Playwright smoke) helps compare “actually runs” versus “looks plausible.”
- Timebox each run more aggressively. Ten to fifteen minutes per attempt keeps the bakeoff tight and fair.
- Make the acceptance criteria stricter. For example: “A new habit can be created, checked in, and persisted across a page reload, with a visible streak count.”

## Closing thoughts

Copilot Pro’s monthly reset is a small scheduling detail that pays off when you’re deliberate. Save bigger explorations for the end of the month, run a structured bakeoff across models, and constrain the problem when you care about repeatability. Whether the agent picks Flutter, React Native, or a web app with IndexedDB, you’ll learn fast—and the next time you do specify the stack, you’ll know exactly why.
