## Finding the Documentation Sweet Spot: Striking a Balance in Dev-Business Collaboration

Ever feel like you're drowning in documents? In the world of software development, collaboration with the business side is key, but so is maintaining clear, up-to-date information. But how much documentation is truly necessary?

This is a common point of contention. Some developers, frustrated by constant changes and revisions, advocate for meticulously documenting every decision. While this approach might seem ideal, it can quickly become overwhelming and hinder efficiency.

**On the other hand, relying solely on memory or outdated documents can lead to confusion, rework, and frustration for everyone involved.**

So, what's the sweet spot? Here's how to strike a balance between clear communication and documentation overload:

**Focus on Collaborative Documentation, Not Mount Everest Docs:** Forget the idea of documenting every single detail. Instead, work with the business and UX designers to create **living documents** that capture **agreed-upon functionalities and user stories**.

**Treat Source Code as the Single Source of Truth:** The implemented code should be the ultimate reference point for current behavior. This eliminates discrepancies and ensures everyone has access to the most accurate information.

**Changes Require Justification:** If a change to existing functionalities is proposed, a **clear justification and user impact assessment** should be mandatory. This ensures changes are well-considered, addressing genuine needs and not fleeting whims.

**Less Meetings, More Focused Discussions:** Constant meetings can stifle productivity. Replace them with **targeted discussions** when specific decisions or clarifications are needed.

**Embrace Asynchronous Communication:** Utilize collaboration tools, emails, comments, and other asynchronous communication methods to keep everyone informed and allow for considered responses. This empowers everyone to participate effectively, respecting different work styles and time zones.

By combining these strategies, we can create a more streamlined workflow. Clear documentation outlines key functionalities, the code serves as the ultimate reference, and communication remains focused and efficient. This collaborative approach reduces documentation overload, minimizes unnecessary meetings, and ensures everyone is on the same page when it comes to project goals.
