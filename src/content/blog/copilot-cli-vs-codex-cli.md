# Copilot CLI vs Codex CLI: Terminal AI Assistants Compared

Developers now have two heavyweight AI copilots to choose from in the terminal: GitHub Copilot CLI and OpenAI Codex CLI. After living with both tools, I put together a pragmatic comparison that highlights where each one shines—and where the friction points still exist.

## Shell Integration Experience

- **Copilot CLI** ships with a built-in shell runner. You can execute commands and let the assistant react immediately, which keeps the feedback loop tight.
- **Codex CLI** does not currently embed a shell. To execute commands you have to pair it with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. The official GitHub MCP bridge exists, but integrating it is finicky and remote MCP connectivity is not reliable yet. That extra setup step breaks the “open and go” flow that a CLI should deliver.

## Documentation and Onboarding

- **Copilot CLI** benefits from GitHub’s documentation portal and VS Code integration. You can find answers quickly, and contextual help is just a `--help` away.
- **Codex CLI** feels under-documented. The assumption seems to be that users will ask ChatGPT for instructions. Discovering advanced flags or learning how to wire MCP endpoints takes noticeably longer.

## Remote Agents and Delegation

- **Codex Remote Agents** are flexible. You can spin up multiple environments, pin different model versions, and even tailor the runtime per agent. Switching the approval mode to “yolo” is literally a one-click toggle, which makes experimentation frictionless.
- **GitHub Copilot Coding Agent** focuses on a single managed workflow. Delegation works, but you cannot customize the remote environment or choose alternate runtimes. It is predictable, yet far less configurable than Codex.

## Configuration Ergonomics

- **Codex CLI** expects you to maintain a `config.toml`. It works, but editing TOML by hand gets old quickly—I would rather use JSON or YAML. Until a proper UI lands, the setup feels brittle.
- **Copilot CLI** aligns with the GitHub ecosystem. Authentication, editor integration, and settings all live where you expect. If you are already invested in GitHub, the defaults just work.

## IDE and Ecosystem Fit

- **Copilot CLI** wins on VS Code integration. Command palettes, inline suggestions, and GitHub-hosted workflows are deeply woven together. If you spend most of your day inside VS Code, Copilot’s polish is hard to beat.
- **Codex CLI** plays better with heterogeneous stacks. Because remote agents are configurable, you can tailor the CLI for legacy systems, experimental toolchains, or custom deployment targets.

## Delegation and Workflow Control

Both tools can hand tasks to remote coding agents, but their philosophies diverge:

- Copilot keeps the workflow narrow, optimized for its managed agent.
- Codex embraces modularity—remote agents, approval levels, and environment knobs encourage you to assemble your own automation stack.

## Verdict

Choose **GitHub Copilot CLI** if you value turnkey shell integration, first-party docs, and tight VS Code alignment. Choose **OpenAI Codex CLI** if you need customizable remote agents, flexible approval controls, and are willing to tinker with MCP servers and TOML config files. Personally, I lean on Copilot for quick terminal work and reach for Codex when I want to orchestrate bespoke automation workflows.
