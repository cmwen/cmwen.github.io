# Reflections on Upgrading to GitHub Copilot Pro

Today marks a new chapter in my developer journey—I finally paid for GitHub Copilot Pro. Having used the enterprise version provided by my company for months, I thought I understood Copilot’s capabilities. But the transition to the Pro version has fundamentally changed my mental model of how to use this powerful AI assistant.

## From Enterprise to Pro: A Shift in Perspective

With the enterprise version, everything felt straightforward. The model was chosen for you, and you rarely thought about the underlying mechanics. There was no need to worry about quotas or model selection; you simply typed and let Copilot do its magic. But Copilot Pro introduces a new layer of complexity—and opportunity.

Now, I have the freedom to choose between different models, each with its own strengths and limitations. This choice isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a strategic decision that impacts my workflow and productivity. Suddenly, I’m aware of “premium requests” and how they affect my monthly quota. Every request becomes a resource to be managed, not just a convenience.

## Unlocking New Features: Coding Agents and Code Review

One of the most exciting aspects of Copilot Pro is access to Copilot Coding Agents. These agents can take on complex tasks, automate workflows, and even assist with pull request code reviews. It’s a level of automation and intelligence that feels almost futuristic.

The Copilot Code Review feature is another game-changer. Instead of manually combing through lines of code, I can rely on Copilot to highlight issues, suggest improvements, and ensure best practices. This not only saves time but also elevates the quality of my work.

## Rethinking Resource Management: Making the Most of Premium Requests

With great power comes great responsibility. I quickly learned that premium requests—those that tap into high-capability models or advanced features—can be consumed rapidly if I’m not careful. To avoid running out of quota too soon, I’ve started to develop a more intentional approach:

- **Save premium requests for Coding Agents and PR code reviews.** These tasks benefit most from advanced AI capabilities and can have a significant impact on project outcomes.
- **Use high-capability models for code design and architecture.** When tackling complex problems or designing new systems, the extra intelligence is invaluable.
- **Switch to free or lower-capability models for routine implementation.** For everyday coding tasks, the standard models are more than sufficient and help conserve premium requests.

This strategy allows me to maximize the value of Copilot Pro without sacrificing productivity or running into quota limits.

## The Ongoing Experiment

I’m still experimenting with this new workflow, adjusting my habits and learning as I go. The flexibility to choose models and manage resources adds a layer of complexity, but it also empowers me to tailor Copilot to my specific needs.

If you’re considering upgrading to Copilot Pro, my advice is to pay close attention to how you use premium requests. Think strategically about when to leverage advanced features, and don’t be afraid to switch models based on the task at hand. With a little planning, you can unlock the full potential of Copilot Pro and take your coding to the next level.

Upgrading to GitHub Copilot Pro has been both fun and enlightening. The new features and options have changed the way I think about AI-assisted coding, and I’m excited to see how this journey unfolds.
