## RDB vs. Vector DB in LLM Applications: Lessons from Building a Financial App

When building a financial application to track transactions and generate statements, choosing the right database is crucial—especially if you want to leverage large language models (LLMs) for advanced features like semantic search or natural language queries. Two popular options are **relational databases (RDBs)** and **vector databases**. But which works better for querying statistics, and how should you combine them for best results?

### The Use Case: Tracking Transactions & Statements

Imagine you're building an app that:

- Stores user transactions (amount, date, category, etc.)
- Generates monthly statements and spending statistics
- Lets users ask questions like "How much did I spend on groceries last month?" or "Show me similar transactions"

### RDB: The Backbone for Structured Data & Statistics

**Relational databases** (like PostgreSQL, MySQL) are designed for structured, transactional data. They excel at:

- Storing and updating transaction records
- Running aggregate queries (totals, averages, group by category/date)
- Ensuring data consistency and integrity

For example, calculating "total spent on groceries in March" is a simple SQL query. RDBs are optimized for these operations and are the best choice for statistics and reporting.

### Vector DB: Unlocking Semantic Search & LLM Power

**Vector databases** (like Pinecone, Weaviate) store data as high-dimensional vectors, enabling semantic search and similarity queries. In LLM-powered apps, they're used to:

- Store embeddings of documents, receipts, or transaction descriptions
- Find similar transactions based on meaning, not just keywords
- Power natural language search ("Show me all Uber rides last year")

However, **updating vector DBs is not as straightforward as RDBs**. They're typically used for relatively static data, such as files or documents, rather than rapidly changing transactional records.

### What Works Best for Querying Statistics?

- **For statistics and structured queries:** RDBs are superior. They provide fast, reliable aggregation and filtering.
- **For semantic or similarity search:** Vector DBs shine, especially when paired with LLMs for natural language understanding.

### The Hybrid Approach: Use Both for Best Results

In practice, the best solution is often to **combine both**:

- Use an RDB for core transaction data and statistics.
- Use a vector DB for semantic search, document retrieval, or LLM-powered features.

For example, when a user asks a complex question, your app can:

1. Use the RDB to fetch relevant transactions and compute statistics.
2. Use the vector DB to find similar transactions or related documents.
3. Combine the results and present them via the LLM.

### Key Takeaways

- **RDBs** are essential for structured data and statistics in financial apps.
- **Vector DBs** enable advanced LLM features but are best for static or file-based data.
- **Updating vector DBs is not easy**—they're not designed for high-frequency transactional updates.
- **A hybrid approach** leverages the strengths of both for the best user experience.

**In summary:** For a financial app, use an RDB for transactions and statistics, and a vector DB for semantic search and LLM integration. This combination delivers both reliability and intelligence.
