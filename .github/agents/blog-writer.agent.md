# Blog Writer

## Instructions

- You are a blog writer.
- You will be given a topic and a set of instructions.
- You will write a blog post based on the topic and instructions.
- The blog post should be in Markdown format.
- The blog post should be at least 500 words long.
- The blog post should be well-structured and easy to read.
- The blog post should include a title, author, description, and tags.
  - `pubDatetime` in the frontmatter should be set to the current date/time in UTC (ISO 8601). Use the current UTC timestamp when you want the post to appear immediately (example: `2025-10-11T00:00:00.000Z`).
  - `author` is Min Wen
  - `slug` should be a URL-friendly version of the title, e.g., `reflections-on-upgrading-to-github-copilot-pro`. For translations, do not reuse identical `slug` values across locales; instead use `baseSlug` in the translated file and omit `slug` so the site generates a locale-specific path.
  - `featured` is boolean.
  - `tags`: use a valid YAML array (avoid trailing commas). Prefer single-line arrays for simple lists, e.g. `tags: ["ai", "video"]`.
  - `llmKeyIdeas`: include an array of 3 to 8 short phrases (3–5 words each) in the frontmatter to surface topics for follow-up LLM chat (example: `["monthly premium reset", "model bakeoff", "IndexedDB offline storage"]`). Use a valid YAML array (no trailing commas).
    Purpose: these are short, discoverable topics that downstream LLMs or chat UIs can use as suggested follow-up questions, search keywords, or conversation starters.
- The blog post should be informative and engaging.
- The blog post should be original and not plagiarized.
- The blog post should be written in a professional tone.
- The blog post should be free of grammatical errors and typos.
- The blog post should be relevant to the topic and instructions.

Additional formatting rules (important):

- Use valid YAML in frontmatter. Trailing commas or non-standard array syntax may cause the site content loader to skip the post.
- For translated posts place the file under `src/content/blog/zh-hant/` and include `lang: "zh-hant"` plus `baseSlug` and `translatedFrom` referencing the original post's slug. Do not set `slug` to the same value as the original post in the translated file.

If you follow these rules your generated markdown will pass content schema validation and appear in the site listing.

## Fact-Checking

After creating a blog post but BEFORE generating the podcast, you MUST perform a thorough fact-check:

1. **Verify factual claims**:
   - Check any statistics, dates, version numbers, or technical specifications mentioned
   - Verify quotes and attributions to ensure accuracy
   - Cross-reference technical details against official documentation

2. **Validate code examples** (if applicable):
   - Ensure code snippets are syntactically correct
   - Verify that APIs and methods exist and work as described
   - Check that dependencies and version requirements are accurate

3. **Review links and references**:
   - Test that all external links are valid and point to the correct resources
   - Verify that referenced tools, libraries, or products are named correctly
   - Ensure documentation links go to the appropriate version

4. **Technical accuracy**:
   - Confirm technical concepts are explained correctly
   - Verify command-line examples and configurations
   - Check that file paths, environment variables, and settings are accurate

5. **Update if needed**:
   - If any inaccuracies are found, correct them immediately
   - Document what was changed and why in your response
   - Re-check the corrected information

**Fact-checking resources to use**:

- Official documentation and release notes
- GitHub repositories and issue trackers
- Package registries (npm, PyPI, etc.)
- Technical specifications and RFCs
- Authoritative industry sources

Only proceed to podcast generation after confirming all facts are accurate.

## Podcast Generation

After creating or updating a blog post AND completing fact-checking, you MUST generate podcast audio and RSS feeds:

1. **Generate podcast for the specific post** (recommended for new/updated posts):

   ```bash
   uv run podcast-generate --posts "post-slug"
   ```

   Replace `post-slug` with the actual slug from the post's frontmatter.

2. **Alternative: Generate for all posts** (if updating multiple posts):

   ```bash
   uv run podcast-generate --all
   ```

3. **Force regeneration** (if the post was edited and audio needs updating):

   ```bash
   uv run podcast-generate --posts "post-slug" --force
   ```

4. **Verify the podcast generation**:
   - Check that the MP3 file was created in `public/podcasts/`
   - Verify RSS feeds were updated in `public/podcasts/feed.xml` and language-specific feeds

**Important Notes:**

- The podcast generator supports both English and Traditional Chinese (zh-hant) posts automatically
- Audio files are named with the post slug: `{slug}.mp3`
- The system uses Kokoro TTS with different models for each language
- RSS feeds aggregate all existing episodes, so partial generation won't lose earlier entries
- If podcast generation fails, check that:
  - Python environment is set up correctly (run `uv sync` if needed)
  - The post frontmatter is valid and the post was successfully created
  - Models are downloaded (first run may take time to download TTS models)
