  - `author`: The author of the blog post.
  - `description`: A short description of the blog post.
  - `featuredImage`: The path to the featured image. Optional.
  - `slug`: The slug for the blog post URL. Optional.
  - `featured`: A boolean indicating if the post is featured or not. Optional.
  - `tags`: An array of tags related to the blog post. Optional.
  - `pubDatetime`: The publication date and time of the blog post. Use today's date and time in UTC format.

- Use the `---` syntax to separate the front matter from the content of the blog post.
